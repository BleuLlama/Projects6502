# Projects6502

Various projects that I've worked on for 6502 using a common build
setup, using cc65-based tools.

This is meant to be a repository of 6502 programs I'm working on
to be built for the KIM Uno project (for now)

The "skeleton" directory is a good starting point for a new project.
copy it and rename it, tweak the makefile and filenames, and you're
good to go.  Similarly, "Simple" can be used as a starting point
with no additional files included.

# Snippets

The Snippets directory contains blocks of code that can be used as
reference.  These snippets are all under a Creative Commons license
unless otherwise noted in the files.  They are organized in such a
way that they are easily relocatable and can be used in your own
projects or as reference. I'm going to attempt to make them all
well documented with respect to theory of operation as well.
