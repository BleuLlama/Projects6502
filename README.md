# Projects6502
Various projects that I've worked on for 6502 using a common build setup, using cc65-based tools.

This is meant to be a repository of 6502 programs I'm working on to be
built for the Kim Uno project (for now)

The "skeleton" directory is a good starting point for a new project.
copy it and rename it, tweak the makefile and filenames, and you're
good to go.
